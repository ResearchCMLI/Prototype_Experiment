  <p>
    Air is one of the important natural resources that helps human to live on the earth. It comprises of mixture of components combined together in the presence of the atmosphere. The air is polluted with various gases like carbon dioxide, Lead (PB), Nitrogen Oxide, Ozone (O3), sulphur dioxide, ethanol and other pollutants.  
  </p>
  <p>
    when there is no adequate forest resource in the earth, and there will be insufficient air for human and other living organisms to live on the earth. Air quality has to be properly monitored in order to control the air pollution and control the fumes due to forest fire. 
Therefore, in order to monitor the air quality this small prototype model will be helpful. This prototype will monitor the air quality and alert the user when the quality of the air reaches certain level. The sensor used here to monitor the air quality is MQ135 sensor. In gas industries MQ3 is used widely to prevent leakage of gas and also it monitors the level of gas to save the people form accidents which is caused in industries. Gas sensor is widely used in oil industries to prevent the gas leakage

    <p>
      Gas sensor detects the gas which is present in the atmosphere.  There are four different types of gas sensor. Each sensor has its own unique feature. In this experiment MQ135 is used to detect the air quality. This type of gas sensor will work based on the sensing material which is present inside the sensor. There will be comparator for adjusting the particular value of gas, when the gas concentration exceeds the threshold, the digital pin will be set to high. Analog pin will be used for measuring the concentration of the gas. Each sensor detects different types of gas. The table 4.1.4 explains each sensor and its own characteristics. Here MQ135 is used to detect the air quality. The sensor has three pins 5V, GND and A0 pin. Operating voltage for the sensor is 2.5V to 5V. The figure depicts the picture of MQ135 sensor and table 4.1.3 explains the pin configuration about the sensor which is described with its purpose. Fig 4.1.2 displays the image.
