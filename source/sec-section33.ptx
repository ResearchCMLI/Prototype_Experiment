  <title>Introduction </title>
  <p>
    Hand sanitizer is an antiseptic liquid which is used to kill the germs. In this pandemic situation sanitizer plays a major role to save us from the virus. WHO instructs the people, to wash their hands for more than 20 seconds to kill the corona virus. We often use sanitizer in public places, there might be a situation to use the sanitizer which is also used by the infected person that may increase the risk of transmitting the viruses so easily. To avoid this kind of situation, automatic sanitizer will detect the person’s hand when the hand is place before the sanitizer and it will dispense the sanitizer without human’s touch. This prototype model will be used as touch free sanitizer to avoid the spread of corona virus. In this prototype IR sensor is used.

      <title>IR Sensor </title>
      <p>
        IR sensor is an electronic sensor which measures and detects any object around the surroundings. There are two kind of IR sensor, active and passive, active infrared sensor has two parts LED and a receiver. When the object is closer the infra-red light emitted from the LED will hit the object and reflect back to the receiver.

      <term>IR sensor VS Proximity </term>
      <p>
        Active sensor is also called as proximity sensor, (ultrasonic sensor). Active sensor will be used for calculating distance. Passive infrared sensor will only detect the IR radiation from the object. IR sensor acts in a same way of how PIR sensor acts.
      </p>
      <p>
        IR sensor has two LED one acts as emitter and other one acts as a transmitter. When the sensor detects an object, the emitter will send an infra light to the object and the object will reflect back the rays to the receiver. When the receiver receives the IR signal, it will trigger the micro controller to execute accordingly. It has three pins VCC, GND, D0. Each pin of IR sensor is explained in detail. In table 3.3.3, the pin configuration about the sensor is described with its purpose.

  <p>
    The fig 3.3.6 shows that there is no object the so the IR sensor is in its actual position so the servo motor remains the same position From the fig 3.3.7, when the IR sensor =1, IR sends an electrical signal to the microcontroller, controller will communicate to the servo motor to about 180 degree accordingly. When the servo motor rotates 180 degrees, the knob of the servo motor will dispense the sanitizer.
