    <p> This book is purely for beginners, those who want to create innovative products using hardware and software. Main objective of the book is to promote readers into product developers after completing the book. Outcome of the book is to eradicate the fear of taking up a project, especially among the beginners. This book provides information about the software, hardware and experimental setup with step-by-step guidelines, so that they can complete the product development with the ease.  The book contains 20 experiments from simple concepts to advance concepts. Every experiment in this book will be illustrated in an easy and understandable fashion so that all readers can explore the experiments. The book contains experiments from embedded system to IOT applications. </p>
<p>
    Embedded System is a two-way associated working paradigm, both hardware and software.   For example, washing machine, all of you know it has inbuilt software to spin the clothes and hardware to assist people for washing.  
</p>
<p>
    Arduino IDE is free and user-friendly software, so it is mandatory for readers to learn about the Arduino IDE and its features.
</p>
<p>
    The book consists of 20 chapters which are experimental based, not just a case study it is completely a working exposure of different applications. Each experiment is a simple solution for problems in real world, so learners do not skip any chapters because you will miss the adventure in working this application.
</p>
