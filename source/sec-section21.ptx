  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>This experiment guides the learners to blink a 5mm LED, a simple experiment to test the software and hardware components to verify whether installation procedures are correct. This experiment acts as a visual indicator for many applications such as street light, dancing LED and so on. The output of this experiment can be physically seen. This establishes a solid foundation for learners to undertake complex problems in the future. This kind of concept is used in electronic devices like traffic lights. It acts as an indicator to know the state change when the current passes through it. Dancing LED in highways is one of the major applications, of turning on the LED. Dancing LED is a visual sign indicator in highways to prevent accidents between heavy load vehicles.</p>

    <p>Resistor is a passive two terminal electrical component which can be fixed in a hole. It is used to control the flow of the current, which divides the required voltage for each component. Behaviour of the resistor is based on Ohmâ€™s Law V=IR. </p>
    <p>There are different types of resistors, such as fixed resistor, variable resistor, thermistors and light dependent resistors that are used in industries.</p>
    <p>LED is a small diode that can handle only 5V of the current. Therefore, to avoid failure of the LED, resistors are used. Fig 2.1.2 shows the image of a simple resistor.</p>

    <p>LED stands for Light Emitting Diode which emits light when current passes through it and it is a semiconductor device that conducts an electrical property. LED has two legs, longer leg is called as anode (positive) and shorter leg is called as (negative) cathode. LED is smaller in size, easy to handle and the cost of the LED is cheap. LED can be used in remote control devices to work   in a short range of frequency fig 2.1.3; LED image is given for understanding purpose.</p>

  <term>Code Explanation </term>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        Pin Mode function is used to configure a specific pin either for input or output purpose. 
      </p>
