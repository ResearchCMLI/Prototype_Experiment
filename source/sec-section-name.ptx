  <title>Introduction to the Micro-Controller</title>

  <p> In this chapter, learners can learn about embedded systems briefly and also about the history of different micro controllers.</p>
<p>Embedded system is a combination of both software and hardware to perform a specific task.  It is a part of complete device that often embeds with some electrical hardware, electronic hardware and some mechanical parts to perform a physical task. It has a real time computing constraints that work based on guaranteed response at a specific time constraint. Embedded system has in built processor, memory and input /output peripheral to perform a complex task.</p>
<subsection>
  <title>About Micro Controller</title>
<p>Micro controller is a small computer with IC (Integrated Circuit) to govern the operations. Micro controller acts as a heart of the embedded system.  It is a complete package that consists of I/O peripherals, memory. It is made up of three components they are</p>
<ul>
  <li> Hardware </li>
  <li> Software </li>
  <li> Real time operating system.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Hardware, It is a physically connected component. It comprises of micro-controller-based IC power supply and LCD. Software allows end user to execute vast variety of applications to run on embedded system by modifying the code. RTOS defines the way how the system works.RTOS rapidly switches between the tasks. Multiple functions can run in a single processing core. </p>
<p><term>Genesis of Micro-controller</term></p>
<p>AVR is a group of micro controllers developed by ATMEL Corporation from 1996. Atmel is now acquired by Microchip Technology from 2016. It was developed based on 8-bit RISC single-chip micro controller. It is first micro controller to use on-chip flash memory. Other opponent micro controllers had EEPROM, ROM, RAM for firmware storage in late 90’s.</p>

<title>Beneficiaries of Arduino </title>
<p>Arduino is a cool effective platform which makes everyone as a better developer. The beneficiaries of Arduino anyone who have interest to develop a new innovative product, however, it is meant for everyone</p>
<p>Arduino is mainly used for prototype model developing. The purpose of Arduino is to make learners learn and create projects/products using their innovative ideas. Arduino is recommended for its low cost and open-source platform where learners can easily learn the electronics and programming. As the development of the technologies increases the need for Arduino is also increasing. It is actively used for beginners, hobbyist and enthusiasts to develop mini-scale projects. In recent times electronics and electrical students have shown interested to use Arduino boards.</p>
<p>Today, academics and educational institutions are encouraging students to develop projects with the help of Arduino. Usage of Arduino in industrial productions has increased rapidly. The knowledge gained from here i.e.  Architecture of the micro controller, interfaces and external peripherals can be used in Industrial IOT.The fields like Farming, Healthcare and even a layman’s task is the active research areas of Arduino.</p>
