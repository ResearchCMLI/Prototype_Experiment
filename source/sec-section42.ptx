    <p>
      Fire accidents are common disasters in India. According to the report of ADSI in 2019, 11,037 fire accidents have been reported across the nation. These kinds of disaster may lead to loss of lives. To avoid this kind of disaster, fire alarm is used as an effective system to prevent fire accidents. Nowadays there is enough security to save the people from Fire accidents. It is used in many countries to save the lives of the people from fire accidents.  It Monitors the environment and helps the people to know when there is a fire accident. Flame detector is the vast application to use in industries which are easily exposed to fire. Flame detector is used to prevent forest fire. Here a small prototype model is developed to detect the fire using flame sensor and alarm the people Table 4.2.1, illustrates the components required for the fire alarm is listed with its purpose

      A flame-sensor is a kind of detector which is mainly designed for detecting as well as responding in occurrence with fire. This sensor is used mainly in industrial boilers.The speed of these sensor is faster and more accurate when compared with a smoke detector. Fig 4.2.2, displays the image of the flame sensor. Table 4.2.3 displays the pin configuration of the sensor with its following purpose.

      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        In void loop function, using analogRead function will convert the flame value generated from the sensor to analog value. 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Generated analog value will be stored in an integer variable. 
      </p>

    <li>
      <p>
        This prototype will work according to the following condition, when the presence of the fire is less than 100 the LED remains in on state and buzzer will alert the people or else the LED, Buzzer remains in off state.

  <p>
    When the value of the flame sensor is higher than the threshold, i.e., when the value is greater than 100, LED will blink in association with the buzzer to indicate the people in the surrounding.
