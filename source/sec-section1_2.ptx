  <title>Introduction to the Software </title>
  <p> Software is used to execute the set of instructions programmed to the computer.  Software plays a major role in transforming the ideas into a prototype model. Here in this book, Arduino IDE, PLX-DAQ and Thonny software is used to write code and execute our prototype modules.</p>

    <p>Arduino IDE is free open-source software available on the internet. IDE is cross platform application that runs on Windows, Linux and Mac operating system. The essence of coding is based on C and C++ language.  IDE is used to write and upload the code to physical Arduino boards, and also other third-party development boards like. This chapter discusses about, how to install the software in the computer through easy steps to make the learners understand.</p>
    <p>Before going for installation, we can choose any board you like Arduino UNO, Nano and MEGA boards and a USB cable to upload the code to the board.  In case you have versions of UNO, MEGA 2560 boards, you need a standard USB cable (A plug to B plug) shown in the figure 1.2.1. If you have an Arduino Nano board, you will need an USB cable (A plug to Mini Bplug) shown in the following figure 1.2.2  </p>
