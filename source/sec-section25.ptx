  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>
    Food is the main source of energy for Human. Quality of the food is more important and also it is mandatory to maintain the safety and hygiene of the food to keep the food fresh and edible. There are different parameters to determine the decomposition of food, they are temperature, humidity and bacterium present in the food. When the temperature of the food is between 40F-140F the level of ethanol gas will be higher, then it is said to be a decomposed food .Table 2.5.1, illustrates the components required for experiment is listed with its purpose.it Monitors the food and prevents the food from decomposition. It saves people from food poisoning. In this experiment learners will learn about monitoring of food quality using Arduino UNO.

    <title>DHT11 sensor </title>
    <p>
      DHT11 sensor detects both temperature and humidity present in the environment. This type of sensor is blended with NTC to measure temperature and it has an 8-bit micro controller to display the serial data. This sensor is built in such a way to detect both temperature and humidity in a single sensor. It is easy to interface with micro controller. Data pin is called as out pin can be used for both Analog and Digital. It can measure the temperature between 0 degree Celsius to 50 degrees celsius. The sensor has three pins 5V, GND and out pin. Operating voltage of the sensor is 2.5v to 5V.  LM135 sensor measures only the room tempertaure of the environment. Here DHT11 is used because it can measure both temperature and humidity.

    The decomposed apple is used to detect the accuracy of the prototype.  Average ethanol level in the decomposed food will be higher than 100. The temperature, humidity of the food is also calculated and displayed in the serial monitor.  Figure 2.5.8, displays temperature, humidity and gas value of the model is in the serial monitor
