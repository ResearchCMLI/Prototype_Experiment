    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>
      In this smart world, home automation is a prominent area where smart technology plays a major role in accessing our home appliances. In this experiment you will know how home automation plays a significant role and also will believe learners will have a huge impact about home automation. This experiment is a simple and renewable prototype for home automation which activates on/off the light automatically based on the clap sound.  It acts as helping aid for differently abled people to access their electrical appliances in their home or workplace. Automatic clapper is a machine which controls the light by making any sound. It can be used to on/off light without any human intervention. It is much useful for differently abled people to access their electrical appliances without any hindrances. It can be effectively used in home, offices and college.

      <title>Sound Sensor </title>
      <p>
        Sound sensor will detect the sound wave from the microphone attached in the sensor. The sound sensor has its own inbuilt microphone, a peak detector and an amplifier to convert the sound signal to voltage. Microphone will detect the sound generated from any external force, then the sound will be further converted to an operating voltage, then the operating voltage will be sent to micro controller for further execution.  Sensor has three pins D0, +, -.

        D0 is used as input pin for reading the data, VCC and GND is used as input pins for power supply.  Sound sensor works similarly to the working of human ear that consists of diaphragm. Diaphragm will convert the vibration into digital signal. It is widely used in applications like mobile phones and audio systems. LM393 sound sensor is shown in fig 2.3.2. From table 2.3.3 the pin configuration of the sound sensor is explained with its purpose. Sound sensor has its own variation. The characteristics of the sensor depend on the type of microphones used. There are different types of micro phone i.e.  Carbon micro phone, ribbon microphone, dynamic microphone and condenser micro phone.  LM393 is preferred widely for applications like hearing aid and also for radio and television broadcasting.

    <p>
      From the fig 2.3.6 wiring diagram which shows how the sound sensor detects the sound made by the hands and LED is blinking. From the fig 2.3.7, we can understand that is no sound from any external sources, so the LED remains in the OFF state.
