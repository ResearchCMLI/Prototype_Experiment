  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>
    In this experiment leaners will learn about automatic parking system. India is the third largest country, emerging in automobile industry. Comparing with financial year of 2017-2018 the sales of passenger vehicles has increased from 2.70% for two-wheeler 4.80 % and for three-wheeler has increased to 10.27%. As the production of the vehicle gradually increases, the necessity for parking the vehicle becomes a chaos in our daily life. In abroad countries there are automated parking system and fine allotment for parking for more than the fixed time. In India, there is no such facility to automate our parking system. Here is the small prototype will help us to know the free slot to park our vehicles and it will notify us when there are no slots free. IR sensor is used to detect the presence of the vehicle and indicate the people, who are waiting to park their vehicle. Table 3.4.1 contains the components required for the experiment. Parking allotment reduces the man power to guard the parking system. It minimizes the waiting time. It also helps drivers to locate the parking spots easily.

    The above picture shows the project proposed by the government of Madhya Pradesh where the automatic car parking system displays the space available to park the car. A small prototype is developed with minimal components to test the prototype.

    <caption>Red led indicates slot 2 is occupied and slot 1 is free  </caption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    From the above fig 3.4.5, we can understand that LED blink is to indicate the slot 2 is full and slot 1 is free, and in fig 3.4.4, shows one of the LED blinks indicate the slot 1 is full and slot 2 is free.
